---Call this to start up HAL. This is required for robot programs.

---This must be called before any other HAL functions. Failure to do so will
---result in undefined behavior, and likely segmentation faults. This means that
---any statically initialized variables in a program MUST call this function in
---their constructors if they want to use other HAL calls.
---
---The common parameters are 500 for timeout and 0 for mode.
---
---This function is safe to call from any thread, and as many times as you wish.
---It internally guards from any reentrancy.
---
---The applicable modes are:
---  0: Try to kill an existing HAL from another program, if not successful,
---error.
---  1: Force kill a HAL from another program.
---  2: Just warn if another hal exists and cannot be killed. Will likely result
---in undefined behavior.
